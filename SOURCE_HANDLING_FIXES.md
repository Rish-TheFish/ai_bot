# Source Handling Fixes - No Sources for "No Information" Responses

## üö® **Problem Identified**
When the AI responds with "no information available" or similar phrases, it was still showing sources in the CSV output. This is incorrect because:

- **Sources should only be listed when they contributed to crafting the answer**
- **"No information" responses have no sources to cite**
- **Showing sources for no-information answers is misleading**

## ‚úÖ **Fixes Implemented**

### 1. **Smart Source Detection**

#### **No-Information Phrase Detection**
```python
no_info_phrases = [
    "no specific information found", "no information found", "i don't have specific information",
    "not mentioned", "not found", "no information available", "i don't know"
]

answer_lower = answer.lower()
has_no_info = any(phrase in answer_lower for phrase in no_info_phrases)
```

#### **Conditional Source Assignment**
```python
if has_no_info:
    # If answer indicates no information, don't show sources
    source_data = {
        "summary": "No sources - no information found",
        "detailed": "No sources - no information found"
    }
else:
    # Normal case: show sources that contributed to the answer
    source_data = {
        "summary": sources_summary if sources else "N/A",
        "detailed": sources_detailed if sources else "N/A"
    }
```

### 2. **Enhanced Prompt Instructions**

#### **Clear Source Citation Rules**
- **When information is found**: Cite specific sources using `[filename]` format
- **When no information**: Say "No information available about [topic]" and DO NOT list sources

#### **Example in Prompt**
```
IMPORTANT: If you find relevant information, cite the specific sources. 
If you find NO relevant information after thorough search, say 
"No information available about [topic]" and DO NOT list any sources.

EXAMPLES:
- "Are backups required?" ‚Üí "Yes, daily backups are required per [policy.pdf]"
- "What is the alien policy?" ‚Üí "No information available about alien policy"
```

### 3. **Early Return Case Handling**

#### **No Documents Found**
```python
if not docs:
    return ("I don't have specific information about that in the current documents.", 
            0, 
            {"summary": "N/A", "detailed": "N/A"}, 
            "I don't have specific information about that in the current documents.")
```

## üîç **How It Works Now**

### **Scenario 1: Information Found**
```
Question: "What is the backup policy?"
Answer: "Daily backups required at 2 AM per [Backup_Policy.pdf]"
Sources: "Backup_Policy.pdf (page 5)"
```

### **Scenario 2: No Information Found**
```
Question: "What is the alien policy?"
Answer: "No information available about alien policy"
Sources: "No sources - no information found"
```

### **Scenario 3: No Documents Retrieved**
```
Question: "What is the alien policy?"
Answer: "I don't have specific information about that in the current documents"
Sources: "N/A"
```

## üìä **Expected Results**

### **Before (Incorrect)**
- ‚ùå "No information available about alien policy" ‚Üí Sources: "Policy1.pdf, Policy2.pdf"
- ‚ùå "I don't know about that" ‚Üí Sources: "Document1.pdf (page 3)"

### **After (Correct)**
- ‚úÖ "No information available about alien policy" ‚Üí Sources: "No sources - no information found"
- ‚úÖ "I don't know about that" ‚Üí Sources: "No sources - no information found"

## üß™ **Testing Recommendations**

### **Test 1: No Information Responses**
1. Ask about topics not in the documents
2. Verify sources show "No sources - no information found"
3. Check CSV output has correct source handling

### **Test 2: Information Found Responses**
1. Ask about topics that are in the documents
2. Verify sources show actual document references
3. Check citations are accurate

### **Test 3: Mixed Responses**
1. Upload questionnaire with both types of questions
2. Verify correct source handling for each type
3. Check CSV output is consistent

## üöÄ **Benefits**

### **Accuracy**
- Sources only shown when they actually contributed to the answer
- No misleading source citations for "no information" responses

### **User Experience**
- Clear distinction between found and not-found information
- Honest representation of what sources were used

### **Data Quality**
- CSV output accurately reflects source usage
- Better data analysis and reporting

## ‚úÖ **Verification Checklist**

- [x] No-information phrase detection implemented
- [x] Conditional source assignment working
- [x] Prompt instructions updated for clarity
- [x] Early return case handled correctly
- [x] Source data structure properly managed
- [x] CSV output will show correct sources

## üéØ **Result**

**Accurate source handling achieved.** Sources are now only listed when they actually contributed to crafting the answer. "No information" responses will show "No sources - no information found" instead of misleading source citations.
