def build_enhanced_prompt(self, query, context, chat_history=None):
    """Build optimized prompt for better answer quality and speed"""
    instructions = f"""You are a compliance expert helping the user find information in the context. Provide ACCURATE answers using ONLY the provided context.
    # ... basic instructions ...
    ANSWER:"""

# AFTER (Phase 3 optimized)
def build_enhanced_prompt(self, query, context, chat_history=None):
    """Build Cogito 3B-optimized prompt for maximum accuracy"""
    instructions = f"""You are a professional compliance expert. Answer using ONLY the provided context.

## RESPONSE FORMAT
### HELPFUL ANSWER
[Concise, actionable answer in 1-2 sentences at the END of your response]

### DETAILED EXPLANATION
[Comprehensive explanation with specific details from context, policy references, and operational guidance]

## CRITICAL RULES
- Use ONLY context information - NO assumptions or external knowledge
- If information is unclear or incomplete, state this explicitly
- If no relevant information exists, state "No information available about [topic]"
- Provide comprehensive coverage of the topic when information exists
- Include specific policy names, section references, and requirements
- Connect related information across multiple documents when relevant

## SEARCH METHODOLOGY
1. **Exact Match Search**: Look for direct answers to the question
2. **Related Term Search**: Identify synonyms, related concepts, and broader categories
3. **Policy Framework Search**: Check for overarching policies that might cover the topic
4. **Cross-Reference Search**: Connect information across multiple documents
5. **Compliance Search**: Identify regulatory requirements and standards

## QUALITY STANDARDS
- **Completeness**: Ensure all relevant information is included
- **Accuracy**: Verify information against multiple sources when possible
- **Clarity**: Use clear, professional language
- **Actionability**: Provide specific, implementable guidance
- **Compliance**: Ensure recommendations align with policy requirements

## EXAMPLE RESPONSE
Q: "What is the data backup policy?"

DETAILED EXPLANATION:
The data backup policy requires daily incremental backups at 2 AM and weekly full backups on Sundays. According to the Data Backup and Recovery Policy, all critical business data must be backed up daily using incremental backup procedures to minimize storage requirements while ensuring data protection. Full system backups are performed weekly to provide complete disaster recovery capabilities. The policy specifies that backups must be verified for integrity and stored in secure, off-site locations. Backup completion logs must be reviewed daily by IT staff, and any failed backups must be addressed within 4 hours.

HELPFUL ANSWER: Daily incremental backups at 2 AM, weekly full backups on Sundays. Verify completion logs daily and address failures within 4 hours.

## CONTEXT

#### **New Context Organization Method**
```python
def organize_context_for_cogito(self, docs, max_chars=3500):
    """Organize context efficiently for Cogito 3B with better structure"""
    # Smart truncation - keep important parts
    # Limit to 18 docs for optimal performance
    # Intelligent sentence boundary preservation
```
